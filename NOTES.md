# Notes

- You should support Alice and Bob with the client presentation.
- Find out what possible scenarios there are for performing database migrations:
  - What tools can you use in general?
  - What possibilities are there to implement them in Kubernetes (advantages and disadvantages of a solution)?
- As Bob suggested, it might also make sense to look at the architecture and suggest any improvements there to the customer.
- If you think it is necessary, prepare questions for the customer to ask at the meeting that can help you make a recommendation when making a decision.
- A technical demo can be advantageous so that the customer can see the concrete advantage of a solution and is convinced of your technical expertise.
